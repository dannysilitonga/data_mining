# Data Mining HW 2

## Result and Summary

* There is a large std deviation of 2.4520492499784683.
* The violation of normal distribution happens at the extreme ends of the distribution.
* We can infer that based on our dataset, on average, later months have slightly a higher value than earlier months.
* It does not seem that there is any pattern on the average daily return for each day of the month.
* On average, the average daily return prices are higher for Thursday and Fridays than other days of the week.
* But after incorporating the features to the models these features do not seem to have much predictive power.
* EMA50 is prominent in generating positive returns. 
* On the other hand, the EMA15 feature can seen in several days with negative returns. 
* I suspect this is due to cyclical nature of the stock markets. 
* Day of the week, month are set to zero by SHAP. 
* I suspect that this due to colinearity issues.
